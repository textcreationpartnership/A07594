         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For although the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> is an ancient <hi>Piece,</hi> which in elder times, hath beene in great vſe in this Kingdome, as I ſhall ſhew in this <hi>Circle,</hi> in it's owne <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle:</hi> yet it was almoſt worne out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faç't, but renew'd and refreſh't by none, but by <hi>Your Lordſhip</hi> onely.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21792:9"/>becauſe it was a ſubiect fit for a more able man, and a more exquiſite pen: but when I beheld this former flouriſhing Trade of ours, to be threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by many as eminent as imminent dangers, and the very life thereof to lie a bleeding; whilſt I was muſing the fire kindled, and at the laſt I ſpake with my pen, as I neuer ſpake before, <hi>O homines ne perimatis Patriam!

               <p>Things once out of order, <hi>repetitis paſsibus, double their pace,</hi> and run haſtily vnto ruine. The fire that even now was ſpyed in a ſparkle, hath enflamed the whole Citie, all the Kingdome. The Clowd that ere while roſe vp like a mans hand, is ſpred abroad, and hath ouerſpread all our Horizon.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the motiues that led me along to that labour, which I lately offered to the honour of the King, and ſeruice of the publique. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I layd a <hi>Baſis</hi> or foundation onely, for a more skillfull worke-man to erect a more ſtately buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21792:9"/>and fit the ſquare: that ſo in due time I might haue wrought ouer, and fitted each part and piece for their place and vſe. But now his Maieſtie, whoſe eye is not dimme, and whoſe hand is ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the going downe of the Sunne; who wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth when his ſubiects ſleepe, and whoſe candle goeth not out by night; who ſtandeth in the Watch-tower all day, and keepeth the Sentinell by night; out of his Princely prudence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and vnwearied watchfulneſſe ouer the welfare of his ſubiects, hath been graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, firſt, to grant <hi>a ſpeciall Committee,</hi> as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue or enquirie; and now a ſpeciall <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> as a wholeſome medicine or remedie, for the dangerous diſeaſe of the decay of Trade. Which laſt, it hath pleaſed his Maieſtie to direct to many Noble Perſonages of dignitie, and other worthie Perſons of ranke and qualitie, ſelected and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>like a Court Parliament,</hi> from all the parts and places of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And that no due information might be wanting, which might conduce to the reformation of ſo many growing grieuances in Trade, it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the State to honour ſome men of my profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ioyned in this Commiſſion, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their choyce and worth, will no doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſupply whatſoeuer might haue occurred vnto me, for this ſeruice. So that now I ſhall only draw the <hi>Circle of Commerce,</hi> and contract trade to its owne <hi>Center,</hi> the <hi>Ballance of trade:</hi> &amp; leaue <hi>thoſe</hi> other pieces, vnto <hi>theſe</hi> Maſter-workemen, to be poliſht for their vſe, in this Royall Edifice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

                  <hi>Merchants cannot enter into conſideration of the quantity of forraine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities imported at deare rates, and the home Commodities exported at leſſer rates reſpectiuely

               <p>
                  <hi>Merchants do not regard whether the monies of a Kingdome are vndervalued in exchange, by the inhanſing of moneys in forraine parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our monies are exported, when the exchange doth not anſwer the true value by bills, and the monies of other Countries cannot be imported, but with an exceeding loſſe, which every man ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. True it is, that they obſerue within the Realme to keepe the price of money at a ſtand, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Kings valuation: but in forraine parts they run with the ſtreame headlong downe with other Nations, without conſideration of their owne hinderance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merchants doe not know the waight and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of monies of each Countrey, and the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions obſerved betweene gold and ſilver: nor the difference of ſeverall ſtandards of coyne: a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo neceſſary for them to know, to make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by profitable returnes of the provenue of our home Commodities, either in Money, Bullion, or Wares.</hi>

For who can enter into conſideration of the quantitie or qualitie of Commodities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natiue or forraine, exported or imported, deare or cheape, comparable to Merchants? And if the Ballancing or ouer Ballancing of trade by the diſproportion therof, can be ſaid to be evident to any, ſurely it can be evident to none more then to expert Merchants. Or who are more quicke-ſighted into the values of monies, both domeſtick and forraine, gold and ſilver, waight and finenes, then Merchants; whoſe continuall practice it is, to pry into the price and value of all things? For there is no Merchant of any experience, but as he hath one eye vpon the value of his Commoditie, ſo hath hee the other eye vpon the money, both

Otherwiſe, if the money riſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, aboue it true worth in valuation, and the <hi>Exchange</hi> alſo riſe accordingly: if this Merchant doe not raiſe the price of his Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in due proportion anſwerable thereunto; he ſhall bee ſure to come home by weeping croſſe, how ever hee make his returne, whether by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;</hi> or in <hi>Money, Bullion,</hi> or <hi>Wares.</hi> And is it not lawfull for Merchants to ſeeke their <hi>Privatum Commodum</hi> in the exerciſe of their calling? Is not gaine the end of trade? Is not the publique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the private, and the private in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique? What elſe makes a Common-wealth, but the private-wealth, if I may ſo ſay, of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof in the exerciſe of <hi>Commerce</hi> amongſt themſelues, and with forraine Nations? And by your leaue <hi>Malynes,</hi> who are more fit then <hi>Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> if not to execute, yet to conſult of lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Drunkards; or Merchants to vnmaske the myſteries of <hi>Mounte-bankes, Iugglers,</hi> and <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of trade? I marvell who made <hi>Malynes</hi> a Law-maker for Merchants, if he be ſo ignorant of their profeſſion! Hee ſhould haue beene called, before he came to this Councell. The profeſſion of a Merchant is more noble, then to be ſo diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and diſgrac't by ſuch a fellow as <hi>Malynes</hi> is. Merchants are of high account in all parts of the world, in times of peace, and in times of warre.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:21792:17"/>
               <p>Merchants are wont to be ſupported of Kings and Princes, cheriſhed of Nobles, favoured of States-men, honoured of all men, diſgrac't of none: becauſe the ſtrength of Kingdomes, the revenue of Princes, the wealth of every Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, hath a Correlation with this Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>Merchants are wont to make it their glory, to advance their fortunes, renowne their names, embellize their houſes, beautifie their families with the honour of this faculty: and to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the ſame vnto poſteritie, as an hereditary title of honour vnto their name and blood. And this is it, that hath made many houſes and families of Merchants famous in forraine parts: and maketh thoſe Common-wealths flouriſh, where there is ſuch a Spring, ſuch an Of-ſpring. For where the father doth thus ingenerate his ſonne, and the ſonne doth not degenerate from his father, there the Eſtate is kept entire, in it's owne ſtock: there the Spring doth not ſpread it ſelfe into ſtragling ſtreames: in which their fame is loſt, their name put out, the Eſtate conſum'd in ryot: and this is a Common loſſe vnto our Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Merchants I ſay, beſides their knowledge of Commodities, and the courſe of <hi>Exchanges,</hi> and the values, waight, and finenes of monies, and the ſtandards of ſeverall Countries, and their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall iudgement in all manner of trade; all which are but the elements of merchandizing, and a kinde of inbred knowledge in a well-bred Merchant; are acquainted with the Manners,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21792:17"/>Cuſtomes, Languages, Lawes of forraine Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea with the Religion, Revenue, Strength, and Policy of forrain Princes and States: whence it is, that the States and States-men, Governours, Counſellers, and Magiſtrates of <hi>Venice, Luca, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, Florence, the Vnited Provinces of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and many other well governed Common-wealths, are by education Merchants: In ſo much as I may truely ſay, and I hope without any ſuſpition or offence, there's none more fit to make a miniſter for a King, then an expert and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Merchant.</p>

If hee had conſulted with a <hi>Yonker</hi> or Novice that had made but one voyage to Sea, he would haue told him, that the <hi>Rudder</hi> is the cauſe of ſtearing or guiding of the Ship, but the winde of ſayling.

For that's <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> as the Logicians ſpeake. Or if hee had well vnderſtood the name of the thing, he might haue given a better gueſſe at the nature and vſe thereof: according to that of the Poet, <hi>Conveniunt rebus nomina ſaepè ſuis:</hi> For the <hi>Rudder</hi> of a Shippe is therefore called <hi>Gubernaculum à Gubernando,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it governeth and guideth the Shippe.

                  <hi>Velum,</hi> and in French <hi>La voile</hi> the ſayle, is derived <hi>à volando,</hi> of flying and running ſwiftly. For a Ship ſayling with a great gale of winde, is ſayd to fly before the winde. And thence it is that we are wont to ſay, <hi>Avis volat,</hi> and <hi>Navis volat:</hi> the Bird flies, and the Shippe ſayles: the one being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,<note place="margin">Calep.</note> the other a Metaphoricall ſpeech.

                  <hi>is altogether Imaginary and not Reall.

So that the gaine becommeth vncertaine, for the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21792:20"/>Commodities may be ſold to loſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF this were true, that the Commodities in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were rayſed in price according to the value of the money;<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> yet this is no anſwer to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his Maieſties Coyne.

But at that time when I wrote, both the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and Commodities alſo, did afford encouragement for returnes into <hi>England.</hi> For the <hi>Exchange</hi> came then at 33. ſh. 4. d. from thence, which is a very low <hi>Exchange;</hi> and the Commodities of <hi>Holland</hi> were alſo low in price. The former no Merchant will deny: The latter you may examine if you pleaſe, either in <hi>Spices, Silkes,</hi> or <hi>Linnen cloath,</hi> which are the principall Commodities of the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> But better in the former, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the latter: becauſe <hi>Spices,</hi> are knowne by their ſorts: <hi>Silkes,</hi> and <hi>Linnens,</hi> by their goodnes. In <hi>Spices,</hi> if you will, take <hi>Cloues</hi> for an inſtance: which haue gone conſtantly theſe three or foure yeares laſt paſt at 11. ſh. the pound waight in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and at 6. ſh. 6. d. and 6. ſh. 8 here at <hi>London.</hi> Take the <hi>Medium</hi> of this price, which which is 6. ſh. 7. d. and that brings out the iuſt rate of the <hi>Exchange</hi> at 33. ſh. 4. d. The difference of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21792:21"/>time and waight, is vſually ſet againſt the Cuſtome and charges. So then whether you make returne of thoſe 5. <hi>Reals</hi> of 8. whereof <hi>Malynes</hi> ſpeaketh, in <hi>Cloues</hi> at 11. ſh. the pound, or at 33. ſh. 4. d. by <hi>Exchange,</hi> is all one. And the like you may finde in the reſt: And <hi>Malynes</hi> alſo as falſe in the reſt: for thus he goes on,</p>

                  <hi>or doe tranſport them from the Downes, rely wholly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the low Exchange, whereby they are inabled to deliuer their money there by Exchange at an vnder value, in giving there but</hi> 33. <hi>ſh.</hi> 4. <hi>d. and vnder, to haue</hi> 20. <hi>ſh. ſterling paid by bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in England, whereby the kingdome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good vnto them the ſayd</hi> 15. <hi>vpon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THen by <hi>Malynes</hi> owne confeſſion, here's a double encouragement for the carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Kings Coyne:<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> One in the high price of the money in <hi>Holland;</hi> the other in the low rate of the <hi>Exchange</hi> from thence backe againe for <hi>England.</hi> But that the Kingdom maketh good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them 15. vpon the hundred, that make home mony from <hi>Holland</hi> or any other forraine part, at a low <hi>Exchange;</hi> whereby he would inferre, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> therby loſeth 15. <hi>per Cento,</hi> is moſt falſe. For the lower the rate of the <hi>Exchange</hi> is abroad, whereby you would remit home your money for <hi>England,</hi> the leſſe of that forraine money you ſhall pay for the Engliſh money you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21792:21"/>at home. And the leſſe you pay of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne money, the more you ſhall receiue of your owne money: and the more you pay abroad, the leſſe you ſhall receiue at home. And in this caſe the gaine of the Subiects is the gaine of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and contrariwiſe. So that indeed, the loſſe to the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> is of the money it ſelfe that is carryed out, as I haue at large declared in my tract of Trade:<note place="margin">Free Trade. cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> the 15. <hi>per Cento</hi> is gained by them that carry it: the money being abroad, is better remitted for the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> at a low then a high rate: the priſes of Commodities being anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the rate of the <hi>Exchange,</hi> alter not the caſe. So then it followeth, that the gaine in expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Reals</hi> is reall, but <hi>Malynes</hi> ſurmiſes are imaginarie. Will you heare another of his ſlurres?</p>

               </p>
               <p>I Thinke <hi>Malynes</hi> hath told this tale over 1586.<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> times, to one or other, and not a word of it true. For in that yeare, when the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was ſent ouer by <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> into the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> there was a treatie or agreement made of the rates of their and our monies, indifferently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene either Countrey. Then was it agreed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, that the Engliſh ſhilling ſhould goe current in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> at 10. <hi>Stuyvers,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21792:22"/>20. d. <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> produceth 33. ſh. 4. d. for 20. ſh. <hi>Sterling.</hi> But that this 33. ſh. 4. d. was then or at any time ſince, ſet for a <hi>Par of Exchange</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Merchants, I might produce more then 1586. witneſſes againſt him. For all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Bookes of his owne and our Nation kept there and here, which are the Records of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants affaires will teſtifie, that neither the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> in the yeare 1586. nor at any time ſince, went conſtantly at 33. ſh. 4. d. but ſometimes was higher, ſometimes lower then that rate. For this is a cuſtome amongſt Merchants, to keepe exactly the rates of <hi>Exchanges,</hi> for all places every weeke throughout the yeare, from time to time: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as one or other of them is a taker or deliverer of money continually, but as it is a commendable propertie of a good Merchant, to adviſe and bee adviſed of the rates of all <hi>Exchanges</hi> in all places, from time to time. So that this is <hi>Teſtimonium omni excepsione maius: A clowd of witneſſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Malynes,</hi> not to be denyed. But for want of better proofe, he will giue you a precept,</p>

                  <hi>when the Exchange doth anſwere the true value of our monies according to their intrinſique waight and finenes, and their extrinſique valuation, they are never exported, becauſe the gain, is anſwered by exchange, which is the cauſe of tranſportation.</hi>

                  <hi>Malynes</hi> received them from me by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not by number. But for the matter hee obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to mee of omitting the great quantitie of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21792:23"/>ſilver threed, he hath my anſwere alreadie, that it was improper for me to meddle with any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent thing, vnles with him I ſhould haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all <hi>Heterogeneall</hi> things, out of kinde and out of order, as he doth every where. For this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of the ſilver threed, his Maieſty had ſetled, before I wrote, and opened the Importation thereof to the Subject, as in former times. And if there be any cauſe to reſume that action, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman, who hath beſtowed much time and charge therein, will not ſtand in need of my defence, nor be afraid of his defyance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third cauſe ſaith Malynes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>of the want of money in England, is the conſumption of forreine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YOu ſee we are now all in numbers,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here pul'd in pieces by <hi>Malynes,</hi> which I hope he found in ſome better forme. He profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in his title, that his diſcourſe and mine, are <hi>Contraria iuxta ſe:</hi> and yet in this, and all the other cauſes, he concurreth with me: but goeth over and over the ſame things againe, to ſpend time, abuſe the Reader, and fill vp the pages of his <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet</hi> with vnneceſſary repetitions. And for want of matter, he here <hi>maligneth</hi> the <hi>Merchants-Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers;</hi> and accuſeth them to be guiltie of the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ballancing</hi> of Trade, by ſelling the Cloth and other the natiue Commodities cheape, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Silks, Linnen cloth, Cambricks, Lawnes, and other Commodities deare, whereby the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21792:24"/>Scale is made the heavier, in the <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi> Which is a moſt vniuſt and ſcandalous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion laid on ſo worthy a Company, by ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a Perſon. For there are no Merchants of the Kingdome, no diſpraiſe to any, that doe ſo much improue the price of the Cloth, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Commodities abroad; or diſ-improue the forreine, and ſell the ſame ſo cheape at home, as theſe Merchants doe. And for bringing in of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and treaſure into the Kingdome, wherein is the benefit of bringing the Trade of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to an evener <hi>Ballance</hi> with other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, this Company therein exceedeth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all other Merchants. Which trade alone hath brought in aboue 200. thouſand pounds in Gold ſince September laſt. And it were happie for the Kingdome, that if all the other Trades thereof were brought into a <hi>Ballance,</hi> they could produce ſuch a foot of Accompt, toward the advancement of the Exportation beyond the Importation, as may be found alone in the <hi>Merchants-Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> Trade, But this worthy and famous Societie, needeth not my teſtimony, nor can his obloquy detract from it, that hath alwaies obtained ſuch honourable approbation of the State from time to time.</p>

                  <note place="margin">P. 15. §. 19.</note> that the Merchants thereof do alſo hinder the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> by bringing in wines too deare. But if the rate of the <hi>Crowne</hi> be riſen from 64. to 75. <hi>ſouls</hi> in <hi>exchange</hi> betweene <hi>England</hi>

And if the wines bee bought deare, and our Natiue Commodities ſold deare, what doth this hinder the <hi>Ballance of trade?</hi> And if there were no other cauſe of dearnes of thoſe or other wines, or other forraine Commodities, then the price they coſt abroad, or the vnder valuation of our <hi>Exchange</hi> at home, which hee ſo much talkes of here and elſewhere, and is nothing elſe but a meere <hi>Petitio principij, A begging of the queſtion,</hi> without any truth or proofe; neither Merchants nor Trades-men could iuſtly complaine of the dearenes of forraine Commodities.</p>

                  <hi>in Malynes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21792:25"/>account, is the great want of our Eaſt India ſtock: whereas moſt men would haue expected, that the ready monies ſent in Reals of Plate to make the employment of the ſayd trade, ſhould rather haue been mentioned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THis <hi>Company</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> that deſerveth ſo much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cannot eſcape <hi>Malynes</hi> envie. For here he endevoureth cloſely and cunningly to inſinuate, that the cauſe of our want of money is the ready monies ſent to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> in <hi>Reals of Plate.</hi> Wherein the <hi>Eaſt India Company</hi> hath againe and againe, ſatisfied the State; that firſt, they carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way none of the monies of this Kingdome: next, that they furniſh themſelues from forraine parts, of all that they ſend out: and laſtly, that they keepe themſelves within the compaſſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties gracious grant, having ſent out much leſſe, even of forraine money then they might, and had need to haue done from time to time. And if it ſhould be granted, that ſome of that money which is brought in for their vſe, might alſo be brought in for the Kingdomes vſe, if their trade were not: yet can it not be denyed, that the increaſe of the ſtocke of the Kingdome by that trade, is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably a farre better and greater meanes to bring in treaſure into the Kingdome from other parts of Chriſtendome, then the other can bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hinder the ſame. And whatſoever is now carryed out by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would be carryed out by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> if this trade of ours were not.</p>
               <p>Wherein, the action it ſelfe, and the diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21792:25"/>of <hi>Malynes</hi> and others of his minde, doe ſeem to exact from me a word or two of the benefites, that may ariſe to this Kingdome, by this trade. Thoſe I ſhall reduce in a word, either to ſuch as concerne the <hi>Trade,</hi> or ſuch as concerne the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of the Kingdome. In both which conſiſts the happines of every Common-wealth. Now the <hi>Trade</hi> of this Kingdome, may thereby be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt, in <hi>Stock,</hi> in <hi>Strength.</hi> In <hi>Stock:</hi> for one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds imployed in that trade, and returned from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> in <hi>Spices, Callicoes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Indico,</hi> beſides the hopes of the <hi>Perſian</hi> trade of <hi>Rawe Silks,</hi> will yeeld <hi>Fiue hundred thouſand pounds</hi> to this Kingdome, in encreaſe of <hi>Stocke.</hi> In <hi>Strength:</hi> for this trade will yearely imploy not ſo little as <hi>Ten thouſand tunnes of ſhipping,</hi> and <hi>Three thouſand Marriners, Carpenters,</hi> and other <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> in the <hi>Firſt Employment</hi> out and home: and almoſt <hi>as many more</hi> in a <hi>Second Employment</hi> after they are come home; by way of tranſportation of theſe <hi>Indian Commodities,</hi> from hence into all parts of the world. Which is an excellent meanes to advance our <hi>Navigation,</hi> and to employ our <hi>Multitudes of poore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Treaſure</hi> alſo of the Kingdome may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be abundantly encreaſt, both in reſpect of the <hi>Revenue</hi> of <hi>The King,</hi> and of <hi>The Kingdome.</hi> Of <hi>The King:</hi> in the encreaſe of Cuſtomes, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes encreaſe with trade. Of <hi>The Kingdome:</hi> in the encreaſe of treaſure, which is not as ſome think caryed out, but rather conveyed in through the channels of this trade. For firſt, the <hi>Treaſure</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:21792:26"/>exported from hence into the <hi>East Indies,</hi> is not dig'd out of any <hi>Mynes</hi> of our owne, but is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed from forraine parts, for returne of ſuch <hi>Eaſt India Commodities,</hi> as the Kingdome cannot ſpend, and are therefore exported from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other parts of the world. And next, it muſt be conſidered, that if <hi>One hundred thouſand pounds ſtocke</hi> ſent out from hence, purchaſeth <hi>Fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds returnes</hi> from the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> and this Kingdome at the moſt ſpendeth but one fourth part thereof: all the reſidue being iſſued out, muſt needs procure the Kingdome ſo much ready money, for returne thereof as the value of the goods amounteth to; or at leaſt, ſuch other neceſſary commodities for the Kingdomes vſe, in ſtead of that money: For which, either ſo much money muſt haue gone out to procure the ſame, or ſo much leſſe money muſt haue come in, as thoſe Commodities would amount vnto.</p>
               <p>But every one of theſe particulars would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more large and ſerious diſcourſe, then the limitation of my purſuit of <hi>Malynes</hi> will permit. I ſhall therefore leave this ſubiect to him, that hath already ſo worthily laboured therein: of whom,<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Tho Mun in his diſcourſe of the Eaſt India trade.</note> I hope it will bee thought no flattery, if I ſay, that his obſervation of this trade, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all trade, his diligence at home, his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience abroad, haue adorn'd him with ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, as are rather to bee wiſht in all, then eaſie to bee found in many Merchants of theſe times.</p>
               <p>I ſhall alſo leaue the action to the Royall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21792:26"/>of his Maieſtie, to tender it, as a <hi>Elower of his Regall Crowne and dignity.</hi> The rather becauſe this alſo is a <hi>Flower,</hi> which <hi>Openeth</hi> with the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and <hi>Shutteth</hi> when the <hi>Sunne-ſetteth.</hi> It is ſubiect, as all great Actions are, to <hi>Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> abroad, to <hi>Faction</hi> at home.

               </p>
               <p>OR rather <hi>Malynes</hi> hath need of an Interpreter,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> to helpe him vnderſtand what I haue ſaid in

And that the <hi>Riecks Daller</hi> then went at twentie marks <hi>Lubiſh</hi> in <hi>Sileſia, Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> and the parts adjacent, both the Souldiers that haue received them ſo in pay, and the Merchants both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> that trade in the Linnens of thoſe parts, will abundantly ſatisfie any man that doubteth in this matter.

For there is nothing ſo cleare, but may require <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> either for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Iluſtration of the matter, to which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: And the want of <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> is the want of <hi>Authority</hi> alſo.<note place="margin">P.

                  </note> Now all <hi>Teſtimony</hi> may be ſayd to be either <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane. Divine,</hi> as the <hi>Holy Scriptures.

Now you cannot do an Author a greater honour, then to vſe his owne words: leaſt in tranſlating of him into another tongue, you tranſlate him alſo into another ſenſe, as <hi>Malynes</hi> doth <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> I know it is growne in vſe in this Kingdome, to cite in ſpeech and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> for the <hi>Originall.</hi> But ſurely it is more common, then commendable. Becauſe it tends to the loſſe of time, and brings no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Auditor to heare a double tranſlation. For if the Text be <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and it bee rendered in <hi>Greeke;</hi> or <hi>Greeke,</hi> and rendered in <hi>Latine;</hi> or as the manner is, to cite <hi>Latine</hi> for both; neither the Author hath any honour, nor the Auditor bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, more of the <hi>Latine,</hi> then of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21792:31"/>they are both Tranſlations. And if there be many Auditors that vnderſtand not the <hi>Originall,</hi> ſo are there not a few, that vnderſtand not the <hi>Latine</hi> Tranſlation alſo. Which vſe of the Latine Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, hath brought out of vſe, the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and learned Languages. Wherein ther's not an <hi>Iota</hi> in the Greeke, nor a <hi>Title</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a myſtery: In which laſt and beſt, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue hath as great a part, as any other Language of the Chriſtian world: which I ſpeake for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Language, and the encouragement of thoſe that delight in Tongues.</p>
               <p>And thus much briefly for Languages, and for defence of thoſe which I haue vſed for divine and humane teſtimony, which in <hi>Malynes</hi> ſentence doe ſeeme Impertinent.</p>

But when any queſtion ariſſe vpon any of them, they were reſtrained to the <hi>Merchants Adventurers</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Malynes</hi> had ſayd, that the <hi>Merchants Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> might heretofore export <hi>White</hi> and <hi>coloured Clothes dreſt, Kerſies, Bayes, Sayes, Perpetuanoes,</hi> and other the <hi>New Draperies</hi> of the Kingdom, into the <hi>Merchants Adventurers</hi> priviledges, paying Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Cuſtome, hee had ſayd true: And ſo they either doe, or may doe now; and perhaps for leſſe then Strangers Cuſtome alſo. And therefore the <hi>Merchants Adventurers</hi> haue not the ſole power of exporting thoſe things, as is miſ-inform'd and miſ-affirmed alſo.

               <p>THe <hi>Merchants</hi> of the <hi>Staple</hi> never ſhipped any Clothes at any time as <hi>Staplers,</hi>

               <p>But this poynt having of late vpon occaſion, been reſumed into the conſideration of the <hi>State,</hi> it was boldnes for <hi>Malynes</hi> to meddle therewith, and to make queſtion of that, which is out of queſtion, in the iudgement of all indifferent men. Or will you heare his voluntary?</p>
               <p>

So that all the trade of the Merchants of the Staple, of the Merchants Strangers, and of all other Engliſh Merchants, concerning the exportation of all the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made of woll, into thoſe Countries, where the ſame are eſpecially to bee vented, is in the power of the Merchants Adventurers onely: and it is come to be managed by</hi> 40. <hi>or</hi> 50. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Company, conſiſting of three or foure Thouſand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF there be three or foure Thouſand of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants-Adventurers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ 32.</note> then certainely there is the leſſe need of more helpe. And if there be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them that forbeare, and ſo few that trade, then there will be but cold comfort for new men to begin, where the old haue left. It is true, the number of the <hi>Merchants-Adventurers,</hi> is very

But it is as true, that the trade, through the late diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of it, the great quantities of Cloth made in forraine parts, and the too heauy charge fallen vpon the cloth, is become ſo poore and leane, that there is now no comfort in the world in it, for new nor old. But it is moſt falſe, <hi>That 40. or 50. perſons manage that trade,</hi> when there is at this day more traders, then can well liue one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

But he that can talke at large thus in groſſe, can doe it alſo by retayle. Thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay one man alone,</hi>

It is not <hi>Malynes Malignitie,</hi> that can detract any thing from the worth of ſo worthy a Merchant. Who,

It is true that the <hi>Merchants-Adventurers</hi> trade is ingaged in a great ſumme of money: yet not for the ſervice of the <hi>Company,</hi> but of the <hi>State:</hi> and therefore it is a very audacious part for a man of his qualitie, to caſt ſuch a calumny, in the face of ſo worthy a Company. It were a great happines vnto that trade, and other trades alſo that depend on it, that ſome good means were thought vpon, either that which hath beene propoſed, or ſome ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as might be thought more fit in the wiſdome of the <hi>State,</hi> for caſe therein: whereby the <hi>Trade</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:21792:38"/>of Cloth, and the <hi>Traders</hi> therein, both <hi>Clothier</hi> and <hi>Merchant,</hi> might be more encouraged. The <hi>Merchants-Adventurers</hi> haue ſtrugled much to leſſen this charge, even with the withdrawing of penſions and deſerved ſtipends from many: which alas, is like a drop of water to the Ocean: And as it can conduce little to the caſe of ſo great a charge, ſo may it much hazard the honour and reputation of the government of ſo famous a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in forraine parts, which heretofore hath ſhined in the eyes of Strangers aboue all other Nations. Wherein alſo there's a relation to the honour of the King, and Kingdome: both which are repreſented vnto Strangers in forraine parts in their government: and therefore it's pittie that thoſe that therein haue excelled others, ſhould now be inferiour vnto all. Neither doth this man ſo much as ſpare his aſperſions from the <hi>Clothier:</hi> for thus he ſaith,</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>incourageth the Clothier to adventure to make falſe Cloth, becauſe it is impoſsible, that ſo few Merchants can ſearch and vifit every Cloth, as it ought to be done, and the Clothiers conſcience is ſatisfied, for hee ſaith, that the falſeſt Cloth is anſwerable to the beſt price.</hi>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21792:38"/>it is not the ſmall or great number of <hi>Merchants</hi> that incourageth the <hi>Clothiers</hi> to make falſe cloth, but meerely the want of execution of the Statute,<note place="margin">Free trade. cop. <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> of 4. of the King, enacted for clothing, as I haue elſe where ſhewed at large. Now the Statute provideth, that cloth bee ſearcht wet and not dry, as it commeth out of the Mill, and not as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Market. And therefore the wiſdome of Parliaments hath appointed the ſearch to bee made, where the clothes are made. So that if the ſearch be neglected there, it is not the multitude of Merchants, that can help the ſearch, or indeed try the ſearch as it ought to be. For in the winter time, the ſeaſon of the yeare will not afford drying for the tenth Cloth, to be wet and dryed againe for timely exportation. And ſhould the <hi>Clothier</hi> bee detained from his money, and the cloth from the market, till ſuch a kinde of vnkindly ſearch or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view were made, both <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Clothiers</hi> would ſoone be a weary of ſuch a tryall. Neither is there any neceſſitie for the <hi>Merchants</hi> to make this review, for then the great numbers of the <hi>Clothworkers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> that are ſet a worke by the <hi>Merchants-Adventurers</hi> to viſit their <hi>Clothes,</hi> would loſe their employment.

               <p>
                  <hi>If nothing cauſeth Merchants to export more mony out of the Realme then they bring in, but onely the bringing in of more Commodities into the Realme then they carryed out, then it is not for want of a Par of Exchange.</hi>
               </p>

In which <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Exchange,</hi> there is no rate nor price to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the deliuering or taking of mony: but looke how much fine ſiluer or gold you receiue in one place, iuſt ſo much, and no more you muſt pay or deliuer in another. And this is a better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, then limitation of <hi>Exchanges.</hi> For the finenes of monies, is that <hi>Cynoſure</hi> or <hi>Center,</hi> whereunto all <hi>Exchanges</hi> haue their naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion. But if you ſhould ſo limit or reſtraine <hi>Exchanges,</hi> that no man ſhould take or deliuer any mony, but according to the iuſt finenes: then the vſe of <hi>Exchanges</hi> in all places would bee taken away. For then there would be no aduantage left neither to him that deliuereth, nor him that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, when mony muſt bee anſwered with mony in the ſame <hi>Intrinſique</hi> value. For as it is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a Commodity that directeth the price; yet that price is greater or leſſe, according to the vſe of the thing, or the iudgement of the buyer and ſeller: euen ſo, it is the finenes of mony, that dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21792:50"/>the price or value of the <hi>Exchange,</hi> yet that price is greater or leſſe according to the occaſions of both parties contracting for the ſame: which cannot be done in the <hi>Naturall Exchange,</hi> becauſe it admitteth no aduantage to either.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Politique Exchange,</hi> is when mony is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed value for value,<note place="margin">§. 10. The Politique Exchange.</note> according to the <hi>extrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> or outward valuation. Such as is the <hi>intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> finenes to the <hi>Natural Exchange,</hi> ſuch is the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſique</hi> value to the <hi>Politique Exchange.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Merchants are wont to reckon the certaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of mony in finenes, at an vncertaine valuation, in denomination and accompt: ſometimes at a higher, ſometimes at a lower rate. Which is therefore in Merchants termes, called the <hi>price,</hi> or <hi>courſe,</hi> or <hi>rate</hi> of the <hi>Exchange.</hi> And this valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is thus vncertaine, becauſe it is greater or leſſe, according to the circumſtances of <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>perſons.</hi> Of <hi>time,</hi> when money is taken by <hi>Exchange</hi> for longer or ſhorter time. Of <hi>place,</hi> where mony is more plentifull or ſcarſe. Of <hi>perſons,</hi> when the party taking mony, is of greater or leſſe credit, or hath more or leſſe need thereof. In all theſe reſpects, the rates of monies deliuered and taken by <hi>Exchange,</hi> are alwayes more or leſſe. For as it is a common thing amongſt men to ſell one &amp; the ſame commodity, to diuers men at diuers priſes: ſo is it alſo in <hi>Exchange,</hi> when one and the ſame finenes of mony, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by a different value in denomination or accompt. Neither is there any certainty of gaine to the deliuerer of mony in the firſt <hi>Exchange,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:21792:50"/>although he ſeem to haue ſome aduantage in the price thereof aboue the value of fine ſiluer; nor of loſſe to the taker, though hee ſeeme to haue ſome diſaduantage in the price thereof vnder the value of fine ſiluer: becauſe the deliuerer may perhaps be ſubiect to remit his mony backe, in the ſecond or forrain <hi>Exchange,</hi> as much vnder the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of fine ſiluer, as he had before aboue the value in the firſt <hi>Exchange:</hi> And it may fall out alſo, that the taker may gaine by the riſing of the <hi>Exchange</hi> abroad; that, which hee ſeemed to loſe by the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof at home. And if it happen that the mony deliuered in the firſt <hi>Exchange,</hi> bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the ſecond <hi>Exchange,</hi> but otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in trade; that alter's not the caſe, by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes</hi> owne rule; which is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That commodities are bought and ſold according to the publike meaſure of the Exchange.</hi> So that in theſe <hi>Exchanges,</hi> there is no certainty of gaine or loſſe to the parties taking or deliuering of mony, vntill the time be run out, and the returne come backe, from thoſe parts and places, whether the mony was firſt deliuered by <hi>Exchange:</hi> during which time, the manifold oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents which are contigent to trade, may vary the gaine or loſſe to either party.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Malynes</hi> would make the world beleeue,<note place="margin">§. 11. The vſe of Exchange.</note> that there is ſome great myſtery in this kinde of <hi>Exchange,</hi> let vs come a little neerer home, in conſidering the <hi>Vſe,</hi> or <hi>Abuſe</hi> thereof. This kind of <hi>Politique Exchange,</hi> is an excellent policy of trade, I might ſay of State: and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both <hi>The King</hi> and <hi>Kingdome.</hi> It concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

Which is a ſingular benefit to <hi>Yong Merchants,</hi> and tendeth to a very great inlargement of trade. Of <hi>Clothiers:</hi> for when the Cloth-markets are dead, and when the <hi>Clothier</hi> cannot ſell his Cloth, and the <hi>Merchant</hi> hath not mony to buy his Cloth; the <hi>Exchange</hi> becometh a ſuccoure, and ſupply to both.

               <p>Whereunto I anſwer, that firſt denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of monies, doe alter their names onely, not their true values.<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> For there is no more fine ſiluer in a <hi>Reall</hi> of 8. when it goeth at 51 <hi>Stuyuers,</hi> then when it goeth at 42 <hi>Stuyuers:</hi> nor in a <hi>Riecks Daller</hi> when it goeth at 54 ſhillings <hi>Lups,</hi> then when it goeth at 32 ſhillings <hi>Lups.</hi> And next, that as the mony hath been raiſed in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> from that it was in An. 1586. ſo likewiſe hath the <hi>Exchange</hi> there riſſen ſince that time accordingly: which being oppoſed to the riſing of the mony, maketh the one equiualent to the other.

               <p>What vſe is there then of <hi>Malynes Par?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> Or rather what <hi>Abuſe</hi> would there bee by ſuch a <hi>Diſpar,</hi> which hee preſſeth ſo hard, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he would oppreſſe vs much more? For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of the vnderualuation of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Exchange,</hi> which I haue ſhewed to bee but <hi>Imaginary,</hi> and a dreame of his own weake braine, hee would bring a <hi>Reall</hi> loſſe of 20. in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by raiſing of the <hi>Exchange,</hi> vpon all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Merchants eſtates in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and by a ſecret conueyance would conferre the ſame vpon the <hi>Stranger;</hi> which would all fall vpon the <hi>Cloth Trade</hi> of this Kingdome. For all men know, that in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Stranger</hi> is commonly the <hi>Deliuerer</hi> of mony, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Taker.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mony at home, either to draw home his meanes from forraine parts, or els to inlarge his trade. And the <hi>Stranger</hi> is the <hi>Deliuerer</hi> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21792:55"/>here, becauſe when he hath ſold his forraine Commodities here, he is to remit his mony home by <hi>Exchange.</hi> But in forraine parts, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is commonly the <hi>Deliuerer,</hi> and the <hi>Stranger</hi> the <hi>Taker:</hi> becauſe the proceed of the Cloth and other the natiue Commodities of the Kingdome ſold in forreine parts, adminiſtreth continuall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of <hi>Deliuering</hi> of mony for returne thereof. By meanes whereof, this great loſſe would falle vpon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Beyond the Seas,</hi> and become ſo much gaine to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> For the higher the <hi>Exchange</hi> is in <hi>England,</hi> the more loſſe it is to the <hi>Taker,</hi> and the more gaine to the <hi>Deliuerer:</hi> becauſe the <hi>Taker</hi> muſt giue to the <hi>Deliuerer,</hi> ſo much more <hi>Flemiſh</hi> mony abroad, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mony hee taketh vp by <hi>Exchange</hi> at home, as the rate or price of the <hi>Exchange</hi> is raiſed. And the higher the <hi>Exchange</hi> is in <hi>Dutch-land,</hi> the more loſſe to the <hi>Deliuerer,</hi> and gaine to the <hi>Taker</hi> by the ſame reaſon: becauſe the <hi>Deliuerer</hi> muſt there giue to the <hi>Taker,</hi> ſo much more <hi>Flemiſh</hi> mony, as the <hi>Exchange</hi> is riſſen, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mony he is to receiue at home.

                  <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> for euery 20. ſhillings <hi>Sterling:</hi> then if I deliuer there 173 pounds 15 ſhillings <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> I ſhall receiue 100 pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> at a moneths time in <hi>London.</hi> But if the price or rate of the <hi>Exchange</hi> ſhould be raiſed in <hi>London,</hi> from 35 ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to 40 ſhillings <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> for euery 20 ſhillings <hi>Sterling;</hi> which is much leſſe then the ſuggeſted difference before mentioned, then I muſt pay in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 200 pounds <hi>Flemiſh</hi> for 100 pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> receiued in <hi>London.</hi> Or if I be a deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of mony at <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> where I ſhalbe ſure to finde the <hi>Exchange</hi> to riſe in proportion to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Malynes</hi> himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,<note place="margin">Little Fiſh <hi>p.</hi> 86.</note> 
                  <hi>That the price of the Exchange will alter there accordingly,</hi> then I muſt deliuer 198 pounds 15 ſhillings <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> at 39 ſhillings 9 pence, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue 100. pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> at a moneths time in <hi>London.</hi> Whereby my loſſe will be in proportion to the other, with the difference of time.</p>
               <p>If this be the Inconuenience, what will bee the euent?<note place="margin">§. 19. The Decay of the Cloth-trade threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes Par of Exchange.</note> Surely no leſſe then the <hi>Decay</hi> of the <hi>Cloth-trade.</hi> For the <hi>Exchange</hi> is that, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth to the <hi>Engliſh Merchant,</hi> his whole eſtate beyond the Seas, for his ready vſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment thereof in <hi>England</hi> vpon all occaſions. Which is the cauſe, that the <hi>Engliſh Merchants</hi> which trade into <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> doe buy their cloth with <hi>Ready Mony,</hi> when other Merchants that haue not this benefit of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> are faine to <hi>Take time</hi> of the <hi>Clothiers,</hi> to pay them at the returne of their Eſtate in Wares. So that if there ſhould be a ſtop in the Courſe of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21792:56"/>the <hi>Exchange,</hi> then either the <hi>Engliſh Merchant</hi> will forbeare to take vp mony by <hi>Exchange;</hi> or els hee will looke to recouer the loſſe of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> vpon his <hi>Cloth.</hi> If he forbeare to take vp mony by <hi>Exchange,</hi> then he can neither buy ſo much cloth, nor giue ready mony for the ſame as he was wont. Wherby will follow a ſtand in <hi>Black-well-Hall,</hi> which is wont much to be refreſhed by the ready vſe of the <hi>Exchange.</hi> And if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wil not take, the <hi>Stranger</hi> cannot deliuer: and if he cannot deliuer, of neceſſity he muſt be thruſt vpon the <hi>Tranſportation of Mony,</hi> more then euer he was before: and then the remedy will be far worſe then the diſeaſe. And if the <hi>Engliſh Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> muſt needs recouer the loſſe of the <hi>Exchange</hi> vpon the <hi>Cloth;</hi> it muſt either be done in the buying of it at home, or ſelling of it abroad. But it cannot be done in the ſale of the Cloth abroad: for the <hi>Cloth-trade</hi> grones already vnder the preſent burthen that lye's vpon it, which preſſeth it downe ſo ſore, that it cannot recouer it ſelfe: whereof there are 2. principall witneſſes, the <hi>Quantity,</hi> and the <hi>Price</hi> of Cloth, both diminiſhed. Therefore of neceſſity, this loſſe muſt bee expected of the <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier:</hi> which would be a matter of grieuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as the termes of trade now ſtand.</p>

                  <item>3 Others ſay, that they ſhall not bee able to vent their Cloth, according to the high Exchange, eſpecially now the ſame is out of requeſt: and would haue the matter of reformation deferred vntill another time.</item>

                  <item>2 To the ſecond, the Proclamation limiting a time for execution, giueth Merchants ability to recouer their monies, or to ſell their bils of debt for mony, or to buy Commodities for them, as the manner is.</item>
                  <item>3 To the third, experience maketh a full anſwere to both, that there did want no Takers, when the late inhancing of mony at Hamburgh, cauſed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to riſe from vnder 28. ſhillings to aboue 35. ſhillings; which is more then the preſent alteration will be: and Wooll was at 33. ſhillings the todde, which is now fallen vnder 20. ſhillings. So that the vent of our Cloth was not hindred, when it was ſold dearer by one full third: but there was aboue 80. thouſand Clothes ſold yeerely, where there is not ſold now 40. thouſand Clothes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>All which obiections and anſweres,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> are a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy or rather a ſoliloquy of his owne. <hi>Malynes</hi> did well to thinke on ſuch obiections, as hee could beſt anſwer.

                  <hi>The Prouinciall Exchange, is that generall permu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> before noted, <hi>which one Country maketh with another, in mony, in Merchandize, in all kind of Commerce.</hi> And therefore it may well bee ſad to bee the <hi>Periphery or Circumference of the Circle of Commerce;</hi> and <hi>The Ballance of trade,</hi> the very <hi>Center</hi> of this <hi>Circle.</hi> For as in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Exchange</hi> betweene man and man, the gaine or loſſe of ſuch Exchanging cannot bee knowne, but by the returne of the mony exchanged: that is, till that mony bee come backe in <hi>Exchange,</hi> which was at firſt deliuered, as is before declared: So alſo in the <hi>Prouinciall Exchange</hi> betweene Country and Country, the gaine or loſſe which one Kingdome maketh vpon another, cannot bee knowne vntill the Returnes thereof bee made: that is, till the forraine Commodities bee brought in, for the Natiue Commodities iſſued and carried out; and both caſt into the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> to bee waighed and tried one againſt the other.</p>
               <p>For as a paire of Scales or Ballance, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention to ſhew vs the waight of things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may diſcerne the heauy from the light, and how one thing differeth from another in the Scale of waight: So is alſo this <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> an excellent and politique Inuention, to ſhew vs the difference of waight in the <hi>Commerce</hi> of one Kingdome with another: that is, whether the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21792:59"/>Natiue Commodities exported, and all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Commodities Imported, doe ballance or ouerballance one another in the <hi>Scale of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Natiue Commodities exported doe waigh downe and exceed in value the forraine Commodities imported; it is a rule that neuer faile's, that then the Kingdome growe's rich, and proſper's in eſtate and ſtocke: becauſe the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus thereof muſt needs come in, in treaſure. But if the Forraine Commodities imported, doe exceed in value the Natiue Commodities expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it is a manifeſt ſigne that then trade decayeth, and the ſtocke of the Kingdome waſteth apace: becauſe the ouerplus muſt needs goe out in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As for example: If this Kingdome ſend out Clothes and other the Natiue Commodities thereof into forrain parts, which are there ſold for one thouſand pounds of our mony in value; and receiue backe againe in returne, the forraine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of other Kingdomes to the value of eight hundred pounds, for the thouſand pounds ſent out, it is manifeſt that the other two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, being alſo due to this Kingdome, muſt needs come in, in treaſure, to ballance and make euen the thouſand pounds at firſt ſent out. Which of neceſſity, muſt either come in, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or merchandize: if not in mony, then in merchandize: if not in merchandize, then in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and conſequently the more come's in, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the leſſe in merchandize: and the leſſe in merchandize the more in mony. But if this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21792:60"/>ſhall receiue in, twelue hundred pounds in value of the forraine Commodities of other Kingdomes, for the thouſand pounds ſent out, then it is manifeſt, that this Kingdome ſpendeth more of the forraine, then other Kingdomes doe ſpend of our Natiue Commodities, by two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds in the value of one thouſand pounds: whereby this Kingdome is become ſo much in debt to thoſe forraine Kingdomes: which of neceſſity muſt goe out from hence in treaſure, to ſatisfie that which was brought in, more then that which was carried out. And this exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment is therefore called <hi>The Ballance of Trade.</hi> Which you may yet more illuſtrate, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Forme,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> thereof. In the <hi>One,</hi> there's a <hi>Quo modo:</hi> In the <hi>Other,</hi> there's a <hi>Cui bono.</hi> How it may bee done, in the <hi>One: Why</hi> it may be done, in the <hi>Other.</hi> There's a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in both, and both within the <hi>Circle of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee will therefore conſider this <hi>Forme,</hi> firſt <hi>Comparatiuè,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 29. The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue forme of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</note> and then <hi>Poſitiuè.</hi> In the former wee will compare and conferre together, ſome <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Former</hi> and <hi>Later</hi> times. In the other wee will collect the ſtate of the <hi>Preſent</hi> time, and digeſt the ſame into a <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Compariſon ſhall bee of two prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Formes</hi> which I haue found out. Whereby it may appeare, that this <hi>Ballance</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes trade is no conceit or Nouelty, but hath been the wiſdome and policy euen of elder times; to make a priuy ſearch and ſtrict enquiry, by this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21792:60"/>kinde of ſcrutiny, into the ſtate of times and trades. The former of theſe Precedents, ſhalbe an ancient <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> which is ſaid to bee found vpon <hi>Record</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in the eight and twentieth yeere of <hi>Edward</hi> the third,<note place="margin">In the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript before mentioned, in <hi>P.</hi> 18. thereof.</note> in this forme following.

               </p>
               <p>In our <hi>Exportations,</hi> wee are to reckon our forraine Commodities imported,<note place="margin">§. 33. Caution in point of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation for the forming of a Ballance.</note> and not ſpent in the Kingdom, but Exported againe into forrain trade, as the Natiue Commodities of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Becauſe whatſoeuer the Kingdome ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of the forraine, is all one, as that it ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of it's owne.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Fiſhing trades, whether within his Maieſties Dominions or without, exerciſed by his Maieſties Subiects, are not to be diſcerned by the Cuſtomes, becauſe the ſame is freed thereof by Statute: which muſt neuertheleſſe be brought into the <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Exportation,</hi> by the diſcreet collection and obſeruation of Iudicious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, as part of the Kingdomes ſtock.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Cuſtome and petty charges, the fraight and Merchants gaine, muſt bee reaſonably valued and caſt into the <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Exportation:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe are a part of the ſtock of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for if that mony were not laid out in charges, it would bee imployed in the Natiue
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21792:63"/>Commodities, to the encreaſe of the Kingdomes ſtock.</p>
               <p>In our <hi>Importations,</hi> wee muſt conſider,<note place="margin">§. 34. Caution in point of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, for the forming of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</note> that much water is wont to goe by the Mill; which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at firſt ſight a man might thinke, might be ſet, like the Hares head againſt the Gooſe Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets: yet certainly, there is a great waight hang's vpon the <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Exportation</hi> in this regard. For our Natiue Commodities, as <hi>Cloth, Tinne, Lead,</hi> and the like, are of great Bulk and Maſſie, and not eaſie to be ſtollen out: but the forraine Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are of ſmall bulke, little in quantity, great in value: as <hi>Iewels, Cloth of Gold and Tiſſue, Venice Gold and Siluer thred, Silkes wrought and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought, Cambricks and Lawnes, fine Holland Cloth, Cuchanel, Tobacco,</hi> and the like: which as they are eaſie to be pocketed and conueyed, ſo are they very rich to be valued: and this one conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, may turne the <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Importation</hi> much againſt vs, in the <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo whereas in the <hi>Importation,</hi> the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes doe not lead a man ſo neere to the value of the goods, as in the Exportation: ſo that thereby you can neither know, what the goods imported coſt with charges abroad, nor what the ſame are worth at home: there muſt bee due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had, of the one and the other in the <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi> For if a Commodity coſt 100. pounds ſterling at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and is there paid for, by the <hi>Cloth</hi> of this Kingdome, and will yeeld but 90. pounds in <hi>England,</hi> and perhaps is rated in the Cuſtome but at 60. pounds; yet the <hi>Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:21792:64"/>in the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> is to be charged with the value of the Goods as they coſt with charges, and not as they are worth to be ſold, much leſſe as they are rated in the Cuſtomes: becauſe that which they coſt more then they are worth, and more then at which they are rated in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, is alſo part of the Stock of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And laſtly <hi>In both,</hi> in the <hi>Exportations</hi> I ſay, and <hi>Importations.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 35.

               <p>So then wee ſee it to our griefe, that wee are fallen into a great <hi>Vnder-ballance of Trade</hi> with other Nations. Wee felt it before in ſenſe; but now we know it by ſcience: wee found it before in operation; but now wee ſee it in ſpeculation: Trade alas, faile's and faint's, and we in it.</p>
               <p>And now we are come to the <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 37. The End of the Ballance of Trade.</note> which in <hi>Place</hi> is laſt, but in <hi>Purpoſe</hi> firſt &amp; chiefs't, according to that in Philoſophy, <hi>Finis eſt Principium in Intentione: The End is the beginning, in purpoſe and intent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Merchant</hi> when hee will informe himſelfe how his Eſtate ſtandeth, is ſaid to take a <hi>Ballance</hi> of his Eſtate: wherin he collecteth and conſidereth all his <hi>Wares,</hi> and <hi>Monyes,</hi> and <hi>Debts,</hi> as if hee would caſt euery thing into the <hi>Scale</hi> to bee tried by waight: Which is therefore in <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Accomptants</hi> termes, ſo called a <hi>Ballance</hi> of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, or a <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi> And to what <hi>End</hi> doth he this? Surely to try in what Eſtate he is: whether he goeth forward or backward, whether he hath got or loſt. And if it appeare to him by his <hi>Ballance,</hi> that his <hi>Gaine</hi> doth not anſwere his <hi>Expence;</hi> the firſt and laſt is, he muſt either <hi>Gaine more,</hi> or <hi>Spend leſſe,</hi> or els looke to come behind hand.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Maſter of a Family,</hi> doth thus alſo conſider his Eſtate, by comparing his <hi>Expence</hi> with his <hi>Reuenue:</hi> and if he finde, that his <hi>Expence</hi> exceedeth his <hi>Reuenue;</hi> either he muſt <hi>Leſſen his charge,</hi> or els <hi>Conſume his Eſtate.</hi>

We want not <hi>Meanes,</hi> if our <hi>Mindes</hi> bee not wanting: wee want not <hi>Action,</hi> if we wanted not <hi>Affection:</hi> but alas our children are brought to the birth, and there
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21792:69"/>want's ſtrength, to bring them forth. Or rather wee haue ſtrength, and doe not put forth our ſtrength: we haue meanes and vſe it not. If I ſhould tell you, that there is ten thouſand pounds a yeare, caſt away in the ſtreets of one Citty in this Kingdome, it would ſeeme very ſtrange! But he that will conſider how many thouſand perſons there are in <hi>London,</hi> that giue to idle poore in the ſtreets, and what one man commonly giue's in a yeare; may computate at leaſt twice that Summe, giuen in the City and the Suburbs. This Summe of mony thus great, thus giuen, is not onely for the moſt part loſt, but it make's the Citty ſwarme with poore, with idle poore: who as long as they can liue by begging, will neuer fall to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, nor liue by labour. I ſpeake not againſt any mans charity, but wiſh from my heart, that he that is charitable, were more charitable, ſo the ſame were not abuſed, or at leaſt were better vſed, for the publique good. For there is not onely the loſſe of ſo great a ſumme, but of the exceeding great benefit alſo, which the employment thereof, in our Natiue and Forraine Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, would purchaſe to the publique; if the ſame were orderly collected, and prudently orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for the Employment of the poore. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I know not how to wiſh a greater glory to the <hi>City of London,</hi> then to haue the honour, to bee the Founder of ſo worthy a worke, to raiſe a Stocke, out of the free will offrings of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and wiſely to diſpoſe thereof for the poore's employment: whereby all their owne poore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21792:70"/>might be ſet on worke; &amp; an excellent patterne of piety and pitty, giuen to all the other Cities of the kingdom, to purſue ſo noble an enterprize by their good example. And it need not be thought to be a new charge to the City, for we ſee the thing is done already, onely it is not ſo well done: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelfe, the vnworthieſt of all her Citizens, had rather, if I were worthy, be the firſt, then the laſt, to further ſo happy &amp; hopefull a worke. For it will bring to God, glory: to the King, honour: to the Kingdome, treaſure: to the Subiects, trade: to the poore, employment: and proue by Gods bleſſing, a moſt excellent meanes, to encreaſe our <hi>Exportations,</hi> and to recouer our <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi>
